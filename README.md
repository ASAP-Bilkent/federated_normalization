# Bridging Local and Federated Data Normalization in Federated Learning: A Privacy-Preserving Approach

This repository contains the codebase and experimental results related to **"Bridging Local and Federated Data Normalization in Federated Learning: A Privacy-Preserving Approach"**.

It is organized into three main directories:

## üìÅ Experimental Results

This directory contains the individual results of our experiments. Each `.csv` file contains all runs for a specific dataset.

## üìÅ Experiments

This directory includes the code used to run the experiments. Each dataset has its own corresponding runnable `.py` script.  

**Notes:**
- You may need to adjust several variables in the code, such as:
  - Weights & Biases project creation and changing the project name in the code
  - Weights & Biases API login credentials
  - Dataset paths
- Datasets are **not** included in this repository. Please download them from their official sources and update the dataset path variables in the code accordingly.
- A `requirements.yml` file is provided to set up the Python environment. You can create a conda environment using:

```bash
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```

## üìÅ Privacy Implementations

This directory contains proof-of-concept implementations of our proposed privacy-preserving federated normalization techniques. It includes simulations for each normalization technique discussed in the paper.

To run these implementations:

- Make sure you have **Go version 1.21.6** installed.
- Navigate to the directory and run:

```bash
go mod download
```

to install the required Go modules.
